s.description      = <<-DESC
Give your images the finger with SwiftyJot! Lightweight library lets users mark up a photo/image.
Options to allow user to select color and brush size. Multi-level undo and one level redo. Inspired
by the (now abandoned) jot object-C library from IFTTT but all new code, 100% Swift.
